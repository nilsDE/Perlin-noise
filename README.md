## What is Perlin Noise?

Perlin invented Perlin Noise in 1985 - it's a procedural texture primitive. 

>Perlin noise is a random sequence generator producing a more natural ordered, harmonic succession of numbers compared to the standard >random() function. It was invented by Ken Perlin in the 1980s and been used since in graphical applications to produce procedural >textures, natural motion, shapes, terrains etc. ([From the p5.js reference](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noise))
